# NLP_with_Disaster_Tweets
 This is a small NLP project done with a Kaggle dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/overview) containing tweets which need to be classified as about actual disasters or not. I have used basic text preprocessing like lowercasing, removing punctuations etc.
 I then used an XGBoost Classifier model to get an F1 score of approximately 0.7. I used this model on a test dataset and created a csv submission file for Kaggle which got an F1 score of approx 0.78.
